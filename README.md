## The instructions

### Build flight search (max 8 hours)

Build an application to book a flight: a user can select a departure and a enter the arrival location, the desired departure date and the number of people. After clicking the search button you get an overview of found flights. If the user can select a flight the user enters his data and the user gets an overview of the data. The focus is on the flight search, the data may be mocked (JSON), or come from an API. Of course it doesn't have to work completely. (For example, only a limited number of destinations) There are no requirements regarding the look & feel.

You must submit the assignment in 2 ways:

1. A link to the demo
2. A link to the repo, so we can review your code and run the application ourselves turn to see how it works.

Good luck!

To be clear: I have specified a maximum number of hours to prevent you from
gets excited and spends 40 hours on it. Less is also possible, of course.
